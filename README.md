# Quiz
This is a quiz that presents the user with questions and grades the clicked answer.  I obviously ran out of time on this project.  I had a health issue on Monday that prevented me from attending a scheduled tutoring session.

## Description
You are taking a code quiz.  Wwhen you click the start button a timer starts and you are presented with a question. I was able to get this working. <br>
When you answer a question you are presented with another question. I almost got this working. <br>
When you answer a question incorrectly then time is subtracted from the clock.  I did not get this working but believe I was on the right track.  I have it console logging correect and incorrect answers.<br>
When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 the the game is over. I did not get this working. <br>
When the game is over you can save your initials and score.  I did not get this working but wqqs intending to write to local storage.<br>
